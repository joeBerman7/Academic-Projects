The objective of this assignment is to design an object-oriented system and gain
implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures, and unique
C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”. You will learn how to handle memory in C++ and avoid
memory leaks. The resulting program must be as efficient as possible.

Assignment Definition
In a faraway Country, SPLand, A war is going on for few months.
As part of the efforts to contribute and take care of the country’s citizens, few citizens decided
to establish a food warehouse that supplies others food packages.
The center is operated by volunteers in different roles, and their job is to handle orders made
by the customers.
The warehouse thanks in advance all the volunteers who do their best to help and improve the
morale of the country’s citizens.
In this assignment, you will write a C++ program that simulates this “Food Warehouse
management system”. The program opens the warehouse, assigns volunteers and customers,
assigns orders, handles them, performs steps in the simulation, and more actions that will be
described later.
